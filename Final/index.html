<h2>About Arist</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Michael Murray born and raised in Chicago, Illinois by my loving parents. Currently I live in East Lansing, Michigan where I attend school at Michigan State University where I am a Media and Information Major with a minor in Game Design. While I enjoy playing/creating video games I also have a interested in reviewing different types of elements of video games from the software used in the game to the actually work put in by the companies who create the games. I hope that through my hard work I can soon enough dive into the world of video game design and make not only a name for myself but also wonderful games for all to enjoy.</p>
