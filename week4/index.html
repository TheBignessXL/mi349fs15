  <h1>Art By Mike</h1>
  <h2>Web Application </h2>
  <h3>A website showcasing the design process and work flow to creating different
    3D models via multiple virtual sculpting and modeling platforms by Michael Murray.</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Art by Mike (Murry.com) will focus on allowing those who visit the site a chance to see how
      to make different types of 3D models and sculptures in a step-by-step format. These steps will not simply
       begin placing people directly into the modeling/sculpturing programs but will start from the vey basics of
       designing art. This includes brain storming, gathering of concept art, and general sketching before beginning
       any actual modeling. The main goal of this style of showcasing is to individuals who are interested in art the
       basic stepping-stones to creating their own 3D artwork. So while they can fallow the step-by-step design/work
       flow individuals do not have to create the same art on the site but instead simply reference and relate it to their
       own work. While being a sight dedicated to helping aspiring artist this site is also for possible employers to
       take a look into the workflow of Michael Murray instead of just looking at the finished model. </p>
